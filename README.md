All of the source code we accumulated throughout the quarter is located in the "Messy Code" folder.
For convenience during grading, we organized everything major in the "Messy Code" folder into the "Source code for Grading" folder.
Please note that the pair plots for dataset 1 were not checkpointed, as including them made the file too large to upload to github.
You can run the program to restore them if you wish.
